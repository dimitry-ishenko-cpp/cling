Description: Interactive C++ interpreter
 Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on the top of LLVM and Clang
 libraries. Its advantages over the standard interpreters are that it has
 command line prompt and uses just-in-time (JIT) compiler for compilation. Many
 of the developers of such kind of software applications name them interactive
 compilers.
 .
 One of Cling’s main goals was to provide contemporary, high-performance
 alternative of the first C++ interpreter in the ROOT project - CINT. The
 backward-compatibility with CINT was major priority during the development.
 .
 This package contains common files.
